# iBeaconPositionning01
Location estimation based on beacon positioning with trilateration and kaman filter

# Use
- create a custom map and place your beacons around your room in th "Map and coordinates functions" section in ViewController

# TODO
- try getting more accurate position with distances to beacons using a multilateration algorithm rather than trilateration
- Limitate position so it does not get out of the bounds of the drawed map
- To get a clearer view of the actual position, only the last "x" positions should be drwaed on the screen. The others should be erased
